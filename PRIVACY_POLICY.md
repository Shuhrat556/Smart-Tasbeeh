# Privacy Policy for Smart Tasbeeh

**Effective Date:** February 27, 2026

Smart Tasbeeh ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app handles and how it is used.

## 1. Information We Collect

Smart Tasbeeh is designed to work primarily offline.

We do **not** require account registration and we do **not** collect personal identifiers such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.

The app stores the following data **locally on your device**:

- Zikr counters and targets
- Active zikr selection
- Daily counting history for statistics
- App preferences (language, theme, sound, vibration, reminder toggles)

## 2. How We Use Information

Local data is used only to provide app functionality, including:

- Saving your tasbeeh progress
- Showing your statistics
- Applying your settings and preferences

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.

Smart Tasbeeh does not include third-party advertising or analytics SDKs intended to track users.

## 4. Internet and Permissions

At this time, Smart Tasbeeh does not require internet access for core functionality.

The app also does not request sensitive permissions such as:

- Location

- Microphone

If future versions add features requiring additional permissions (for example, live Qibla/location-based functions), this Privacy Policy will be updated before or at the time of release.

Your app data is stored on your device and remains there until:

- You clear app data
